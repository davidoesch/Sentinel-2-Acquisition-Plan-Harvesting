# Sentinel-2-Acquisition-Plan-Harvesting
This project is a toolset for harvesting and processing Sentinel-2 acquisition plans, extracting relevant Area of Interest (AOI) polygons, and merging the data into CSV files. The scripts allow users to extract acquisition data from Sentinel-2 .kml files, define an AOI polygon, and filter acquisition dates.
